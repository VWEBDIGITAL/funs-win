		"describe1": "Definition : Money laundering: The process of making illegally-gained proceeds appear legal. This process generally involves three stages: placement, layering, and integration. Placement: The process of depositing illegal proceeds into traditional financial institutions, through deposits or other means. Layering: The process of separating the proceeds of criminal activity from their source by creating complex layers of financial transactions, such as converting cash into traveler's checks, drafts, wire transfers, letters of credit, stocks, bonds, or purchasing assets. Integration: The use of legal transactions to conceal illicit proceeds, making laundered funds re-enter the economy for normal use.",
		"describe2": "AML Policy : We acknowledge that providing services related to online gaming can pose money laundering and terrorist financing risks. We identify, prevent, and limit the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing in our day-to-day business operations through measures, processes, and internal controls that consider the nature of customers and services we provide. With these measures, processes, and internal controls, we comply with all relevant legal requirements. We take measures to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing in accordance with applicable Curacao legislation. We have developed an anti-money laundering policy to demonstrate our commitment to detect, prevent, and report to national authorities any attempts and/or transactions involving our services that meet the statutory definition of money laundering or any other form of illegal financial transactions. The anti-money laundering policy is subject to modifications and upgrades in response to changes in industry legislation and best practices.",
		"describe3": "To comply with Anti-Money Laundering (AML) procedures, we require a mandatory 1x wagering for all deposits before initiating a withdrawal request. Failure to meet this requirement may result in withdrawal restrictions or denial until satisfied. Once the one-time wagering requirement is met, users can request withdrawals based on the profits earned from the deposits. For example, if User A deposits 100, they must engage in 100 worth of betting to initiate a withdrawal. If User A subsequently earns a profit of 58 from this 1x wagering activity, the accurate withdrawal amount for User A is 158. Users can participate in additional betting activities to accumulate more rewards."

		"describe": "Responsible Gambling:\n\nWe strictly prohibit individuals under 18 years of age from playing.\n\nOnline gambling is a fun and potentially beneficial way to pass the time. However, we always prioritize the player's best interests. We support responsible gambling.\n\nWith the development of online gambling over the past decade, it's as easy as a click to access online gambling sites for casinos, sports, lotteries, and other games. Anytime, anywhere. This makes it harder for players to set limits.\n\nOur casino and sports betting sections are designed to provide a maximized entertainment portal, created for pure enjoyment. However, we encourage our gamblers to play responsibly.\n\nAlways remember:\n- The purpose of gambling is for fun and entertainment, not as a means to make money\n- Gambling is not a solution to financial difficulties\n- Set a gambling budget and stick to it. Track your expenses and only use the initially decided amount.\n- Do not chase losses or use funds allocated for other areas of the budget.\n- Check if you only play games during the leisure time allocated to hobbies. Gambling should not interfere with your daily activities. Monitor the time you spend gambling.\n\nAre you a compulsive gambler?\nAccording to the Anonymous Gambler's Association, if your answer to 7 or more questions is Yes, you should seek help for gambling addiction.\n\n- Have you wasted time on gambling?\n- Has gambling negatively impacted your family life?\n- Has your reputation been damaged due to gambling?\n- Have you felt remorse after gambling?\n- Have you ever used gambling to solve financial difficulties?\n- Has gambling led to a decline in your ambition or efficiency?\n- Have you gambled or continued to gamble to win back losses?\n- After winning, do you have the urge to go back and win more?\n- Do you often gamble until you've exhausted your last money?\n- Have you borrowed money to fund gambling?\n- Have you sold anything to fund gambling?\n- Are you unwilling to use 'gambling money' for regular expenses?\n- Does gambling jeopardize your well-being or that of your family?\n- Have you gambled for longer than the planned time?\n- Have you gambled to escape troubles?\n- Have you implemented or considered illegal activities to fund gambling?\n- Does gambling cause difficulty sleeping?\n- When you're feeling down, do you have the impulse to gamble?\n- Do you want to celebrate life's good fortune through gambling?\n- Have you considered self-harm or suicide due to gambling?\n\nUnderage Gambling:\nStrictly prohibited for individuals under 18 years old in our gambling. We conduct random checks using the payment portal for deposits. If a player is found to be under 18 years old, all winnings will be confiscated, the account will be closed, and we will contact the police in the child's country of residence.\n\nWe strongly recommend parents fully understand and participate in their children's activities on gaming devices.\n\nProtect yourself and gamble responsibly:\nIf you cannot gamble responsibly, the only choice is not to gamble at all. This way, you'll avoid putting yourself and your loved ones in danger. Many people have ruined their lives because they didn't adhere to signs of irresponsible gambling.\n\nAll casinos and games have a built-in Return to Player (RTP) or player return percentage and a fixed casino advantage, which is advantageous for the casino in the long run. In conclusion, it's crucial to remember that the money you bet should only be disposable income because gambling is for maximizing enjoyment and fun. These are games of chance; you might win, but you might also lose.\n\nJoin us, enjoy the fun of gaming, and get the support to stay on the right track."
